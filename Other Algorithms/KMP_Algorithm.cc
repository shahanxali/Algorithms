//KMP Algorithm, Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm is a pattern searching algorithm in string

//See explanation here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/
//Must see Visualization here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu2aO_3R118&ab_channel=GBhat

//Know about LPS, how to calculate it, takes n times, then think about LPS for long enough
//Then see the visualization provide, you will get an idea how KMP works.
